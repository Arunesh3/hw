What is the difference between supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning ?
In supervised learning we provide the computer a well labelled data set.
In unsupervised learning we provide the computer a raw data.
In reinforcement learning we want the computer to learn with experience. It is given a little data and then computer learns from its own mistake. Ex- Self driving cars

What is machine learning?
Machine learning focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, improving its accuracy.

What are libraries in Python? Give few examples

Libraries are collections of pre-written code modules that provide various functionalities and can be imported into your programs. These libraries save you time and effort by offering ready-made solutions for common 
tasks, such as working with data, performing mathematical operations, creating graphical user interfaces, etc. Ex - Pandas , numpy etc.
